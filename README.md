## Installation

Add `:nebulex_local` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:nebulex_local, "~> 3.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

You can define a cache as follows:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.LocalCache do
  use Nebulex.Cache,
    otp_app: :my_app,
    adapter: Nebulex.Adapters.Local
end
```

Where the configuration for the cache must be in your application
environment, usually defined in your `config/config.exs`:

```elixir
config :my_app, MyApp.LocalCache,
  gc_interval: :timer.hours(12),
  max_size: 1_000_000,
  allocated_memory: 2_000_000_000,
  gc_memory_check_interval: :timer.seconds(10)
```

If your application was generated with a supervisor (by passing `--sup`
to `mix new`) you will have a `lib/my_app/application.ex` file containing
the application start callback that defines and starts your supervisor.
You just need to edit the `start/2` function to start the cache as a
supervisor on your application's supervisor:

```elixir
def start(_type, _args) do
  children = [
    {MyApp.LocalCache, []},
  ]

  ...
end
```

See the [online documentation][online_docs] for more information.

## Testing

Since this adapter uses support modules and shared tests from `Nebulex`,
but the test folder is not included in the Hex dependency, the following
steps are required to run the tests.

First of all, make sure you set the environment variable `NEBULEX_PATH`
to `nebulex`:

```
export NEBULEX_PATH=nebulex
```

Second, make sure you fetch `:nebulex` dependency directly from GtiHub
by running:

```
mix nbx.setup
```

Third, fetch deps:

```
mix deps.get
```

Finally, you can run the tests:

```
mix test
```

Running tests with coverage:

```
mix coveralls.html
```

You will find the coverage report within `cover/excoveralls.html`.

## Benchmarks

The adapter provides a set of basic benchmark tests using the library
[benchee](https://github.com/PragTob/benchee), and they are located within
the directory [benchmarks](./benchmarks).

To run a benchmark test you have to run:

```
$ MIX_ENV=test mix run benchmarks/{BENCH_TEST_FILE}
```

Where `BENCH_TEST_FILE` can be any of:

  * `local_with_ets_bench.exs`: benchmark for the local adapter using
    `:ets` backend.
  * `local_with_shards_bench.exs`: benchmark for the local adapter using
    `:shards` backend.

For example, for running the benchmark for the local adapter using `:shards`
backend:

```
$ MIX_ENV=test mix run benchmarks/local_with_shards_bench.exs
```

Additionally, you can also run performance tests using `:basho_bench`.
